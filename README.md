### Project Overview
This project addresses the issue of duplicate file management by proposing two algorithmic solutions for detecting and removing duplicate files from a specified directory: a naive approach and an optimized approach, both implemented in Python.

### Objectives
- Apply knowledge of algorithm design and analysis.
- Understand the differences between naive and optimized solutions.
- Gain experience with empirical analysis and comparing results with theoretical expectations.
- Enhance collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills.

### Project Structure
- **Algorithm 1**: Naive Algorithm
  - **Source Code**: 'algorithm1.py'
  
- **Algorithm 2**: Optimized Algorithm
  - **Source Code**: 'algorithm2.py'
  
- **Final Report**: .'CS315-report.docx'
